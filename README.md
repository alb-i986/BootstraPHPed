BootstraPHPed
=============

A general purpose extendable PHP application built on top of Bootstrap (and jQuery). It can be used as a base for creating a cool Bootstrapped dynamic web site.
At the moment, you can't do much without knowing PHP, but the aim is to make it a light-weight Bootstrapped CMS.

FEATURES
 - 2 layouts available for every page: one-column or two-column, with a sidemenu
 - authentication 
 - authorization: fine granularity (down to subsections), inheritance (subsections can inherit privileges from its parent)
 - users organized in groups
 - configurable & extendable hierarchy of user roles
 - sections/subsections
 - administrative UI

DESIGN GOALS
 - low coupling [always inspiring me]
 - cleanness
 - robustness
 - extendability
 - MVC style

TODO
 - make it OO
 - make it more CMS-like
